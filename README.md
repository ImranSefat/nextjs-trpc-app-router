## Introduction

This project showcases the integration of Next.js 13, tRPC, Prisma, and Tailwind CSS to create a dynamic and efficient web application. Next.js 13 introduces improved app routing and enhanced developer experience. tRPC simplifies data fetching and API communication, while Prisma streamlines database management. The UI is styled using Tailwind CSS, providing a sleek and responsive design.

## Features

- **Next.js 13**: Leverage the latest routing capabilities and development experience enhancements.
- **tRPC**: Simplify data fetching and API communication through type-safe procedures.
- **Prisma**: Manage the database with ease using an ORM and query builder.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Style the application with a responsive and modern design.
- **Server-side Rendering (SSR)**: Render pages on the server for improved performance and SEO.
- **Client-side Data Fetching**: Fetch additional data on the client side for dynamic content.
- **Component Modularity**: Develop modular and reusable UI components.
- **Customization**: Extend and customize according to your project requirements.
